        <p>
            My name is John "Jackson" Parsells, and I'm a rising sophomore
            at <a href ="https://www.tufts.edu/">Tufts university</a>. I intend on majoring in Computer Science
            with a minor in Economics. I come from Wilmington, Delaware,
            where I attended a STEM based Charter school named
            <a href="https://charterschool.org/">Charter School of 
            Wilmington</a>. Growing up here, I developed a passion for helping
            others by helping with my mothers non-profit as well as tutoring
            underclassmen.
